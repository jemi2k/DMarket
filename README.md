## IDP Project description
## Title - Decentralized Online Marketplace
DMarket project is a decentralized online marketplace that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate a direct exchange of goods and services between buyers and sellers. By eliminating intermediaries such as banks and payment processors, DMarket provides a transparent, secure, and efficient platform for users to conduct transactions seamlessly.

The project utilizes the Polygon network for smart contracts and IPFS as a database for uploading product images. Additionally, DMarket employs Infura API gateway for IPFS, Next.js as its framework, Hardhat for smart contract development, Tailwind CSS for UI design, and Vercel for deployment to the internet.
